OVERVIEW
  This repository contains  a simple unix shell  written in the C
  programming  language. At  a  superficial  level,  the  program
  supports  much  of  the  same functionality as the  BASH shell,
  albeit with some significant features missing (no scripts). All
  the  same,  it does  support pipes and  redirection, background
  execution, and of course launching executables (like git, nano,
  ls, etc). As for common shell  builtins, the program  currently
  supports cd and exit.
  
IMPLEMENTATION
  The core datastructures that I used are fairly straightforward,
  mostly  arrays,  and some  vectors (I implemented  an interface
  similar to C++'s stl vector  class in order to  abstract memory
  allocation in C).

  In order to parse  the input, I used  a combination of  a lexer
  generated by flex(1), and a simple hand-written parser.
